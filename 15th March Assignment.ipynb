    "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by computer systems.\n",
    "AI can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as understanding natural language, recognizing speech and images,\n",

    "Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that uses statistical techniques to enable computer systems to improve their performance on a specific task,\n",

    "Example: An example of machine learning is email filtering. Email providers like Gmail use machine learning algorithms to classify incoming emails,\n",

    "These models use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to analyze the features of an image and classify it into different categories,\n",
