    "    Non_relational Databases:\n",
    "    Non-relational databases are different from traditional relational databases, since here idea of storing data is simplified.\n",
    "    Rather than following strict convention of first forming schema then storing data based on that schema,\n",
    "     non-relational databases allows us to store data in key-value form or json-like form.\n",
    "    Instead of forming tables, we here form collections and documents.\n",
    "    The ability to digest and organize various types of information side by side makes non-relational databases much more flexible than relational databases.\n",

    "2. Document-oriented:- All the data are stored in documents instead of tables like RDBMS.\n",
    "2. Indexing:- Every field here is indexed with both primary and secondary indices which makes easier and efficient searches.\n",
    "3. Scalability:- It provides horizontal scalability with the help of sharding. Sharding means to distribute data on multiple servers.\n",
    "4. Replication:- With the help of replication it creates, multiple copies of the data and sends these copies to a different server,\n",
    "                 so that if one server fails, then the data is retrieved from another server.\n",

    "6. High Performance:- The performance of MongoDB is very high and data persistence as compared to another database,\n",
