    "\n",
    "1. Use a separate validation set: When building a machine learning model, it is important to split the data into a training set and a \n",
    "separate validation set. The validation set should be used to evaluate the performance of the model during hyperparameter tuning and \n",
    "feature selection. It should not be used during the training process to ensure that the model does not learn from the validation set.\n",

    "2. Avoid using future information: Ensure that the model is not trained on features that are not available at the time of prediction. \n",
    "For example, if you are building a credit risk model, you should not include future payment history as a feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Properly preprocess the data: It is important to preprocess the data before training the model to ensure that the features are not \n",

    "calculated only on the training set and not on the entire dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Be careful with feature selection: Feature selection can be a source of data leakage if the validation set is used during the \n",
    "feature selection process. It is important to perform feature selection only on the training set and use the selected features to train the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Avoid leakage from metadata: Metadata, such as timestamps or unique identifiers, can also leak information if not handled properly. \n",
    "Ensure that metadata is not used as a feature and that the validation set is properly sampled to avoid temporal or spatial leakage.\n",
