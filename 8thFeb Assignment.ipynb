    "    Abstraction is one of four important pillars of object oriented programming paradigm.\n",
    "    It is used to hide the backgroud details or any unnecessary implementation.\n",
    "    For Example: we go to bank to withdraw money from our back account.\n",
    "    We simply insert our atm card, enter the details and amount to be withdrawn, then within a minute or two we are with our amount.\n",
    "    We never think what is happening behind, how did I get my money just by following simple steps.This is abstraction. \n",
    "    The process through which money came out of the atm machine is abstracted or hidden.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    In python we can achieve abstraction by incorporating abstract classes and methods:\n",
    "    Any class that contains abstract methods is called abstract class.\n",
    "    Abstract methods do not include any implementations.\n",
    "    Code Example:\n",
    "    from abc import ABC\n",
    "    class type_shape(ABC):\n",
    "        def area(self):\n",
    "            pass;\n",
    "    class Rectangle(type_shape):\n",
    "        length = 6;\n",
    "        breadth= 4;\n",
    "        def area(self):\n",
    "            return self.length * self.breadth;\n",
    "    class Circle(type_shape):\n",
    "        radius = 7;\n",
    "        def area(self):\n",
    "            return 3.14*self.radius*self.radius;\n",
    "    r = Rectangle();\n",
    "    c = Circle();\n",
    "    print(\"Area of a rectangle:-\", r.area());\n",
    "    print(\"Area of a circle:-\", c.area());\n",
    "    output:\n",
    "    Area of a rectangle:- 24\n",
    "    Area of a circle:- 153.86\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Explanation:\n",
    "    First we created an abstract class named type_shape acting as abstract base class implemented with abc module.\n",
    "    This class has an abstract method named area.\n",
    "    Then we create two more classes inheriting the abstract base class type_shape.\n",
    "    These two classes are capable of overwriting the area method present in abstract base class in their very own manner.\n",

    "        suppose you want to create a banking application and you are asked to collect all the information about your customer.\n",
    "        There are chances that you will come up with a lot of information about the customer.\n",
    "        But, not all of the information is required to create a banking application.\n",
    "        We need to select only the useful information for our banking application from that pool.\n",
    "        Since we have selected the customer infromation from a larger pool, the process is referrred to as abstraction.\n",

    "       Example for Encapsulation:\n",

    " While programming it is necessary to verify whether an object implements a given method or property.\n",
