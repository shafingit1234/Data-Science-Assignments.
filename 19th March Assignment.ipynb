    "Missing at random data means that the reason for missing values can be explained by variables on which you have complete information,\n",
    "as there is some relationship between the missing data and other values/data. In such cases data is not missing for all ther observations.\n",
    "It is missing only within sub-samples of the data, and there is some pattern in the missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For such a case, it is relatively safer to delete data when compared to missing not at random data.\n",
    "We can perform deletion of rows or columns or pairwise deletion to get rid of missing value.\n",
    "1.1 Listwise deletion:-\n",
    "Listwise deletion (complete-case analysis) removes all data for an observation that has one or more missing values.\n",
    "Particularly if the missing data is limited to a small number of observations, you may just opt to eliminate those cases from the analysis.\n",
    "However in most cases, it is often disadvantageous to use listwise deletion.\n",
    "This is because the assumptions of MCAR (Missing Completely at Random) are typically rare to support.\n",
    "As a result, listwise deletion methods produce biased parameters and estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.2 Pairwise Deletion:-\n",
    "pairwise deletion analyses all cases in which the variables of interest are present and thus maximizes all data available by an analysis basis.\n",
    "A strength to this technique is that it increases power in your analysis but it has many disadvantages. It assumes that the missing data are MCAR.\n",
    "If you delete pairwise then youâ€™ll end up with different numbers of observations contributing to different parts of your model,\n",
    "which can make interpretation difficult.\n",

    "1.3 Dropping Variables:-\n",
    "In my opinion, it is always better to keep data than to discard it.\n",
    "Sometimes you can drop variables if the data is missing for more than 60% observations but only if that variable is insignificant.\n",

    "it is the only tested function that takes no advantage of the time series characteristics or relationship between the variables.\n",
    "It is very fast, but has clear disadvantages. One disadvantage is that mean imputation reduces variance in the dataset.\n",
