    "Bagging, short for bootstrap aggregating, is a machine learning ensemble technique that combines the predictions of \n",
    "multiple models to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting. It works by creating multiple subsets of the original training data \n",
    "by random sampling with replacement, and then training a base model on each subset.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of decision trees, bagging can help to reduce overfitting in several ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Decreased Variance: By averaging the predictions of multiple decision trees trained on different subsets of the training data, \n",
    "the overall variance of the model can be reduced. This is because the different trees are likely to make different errors on \n",
    "different subsets of the data, and when combined, these errors tend to cancel out.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Increased Robustness: Bagging can help to make the model more robust to outliers and noise in the data. \n",
    "This is because the random subsets of the data are likely to contain different outliers and noisy points, \n",
    "and the overall model is less likely to be affected by any one of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Reduced Bias: Bagging can also help to reduce bias in the model. This is because decision trees tend to have high variance and low bias, \n",
    "meaning that they are prone to overfitting to the training data. By averaging the predictions of multiple decision trees, \n",
    "the overall bias of the model can be reduced, leading to better generalization performance on new data.\n",

    "Overall, bagging is an effective technique for reducing overfitting in decision trees, and is widely used in practice to \n",
