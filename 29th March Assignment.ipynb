    "1. Lasso regression also known as L1 regularization is a type of linear regression that can be used to select a subset of the most important features,\n",
    "in a dataset. It works by adding a penalty term to the regression equation that encourages small coefficients or weights for the input features.\n",
    "This penalty term is proportional to the absolute value of the coefficients,\n",
    "which means that some of the coefficients can be reduced to zero if the penalty is high enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Compared to other regression techniques, such as ridge regression or ordinary least squares regression,\n",
    "lasso regression has the advantage of being able to perform feature selection. Ridge regression,\n",
    "for example also adds a penalty term to the regression equation, but it is proportional to the square\n",
    "of the coefficients instead of the absolute value.\n",
    "This means that ridge regression tends to shrink all coefficients towards zero, but it rarely eliminates any of them entirely.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Another difference between lasso regression and other regression techinques is that the penalty term in lasso regression,\n",
    "can lead to a sparser solution. This is because the penalty term can force some of the coefficients to be exactly equal to zero,\n",
    "which means that the corresponding input features are completely ignored in the regression equation.\n",
    "This can be useful for reducing overfitting and improving the interpretability of the model.\n",
