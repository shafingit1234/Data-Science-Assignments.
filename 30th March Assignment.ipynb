    "Elastic Net Regression is a linear regression model that combines the penalties of two different reguralization methods, L1 and L2.\n",
    "\n",
    "L1 regularization also known as Lasso regularization adds a penalty term to the objective function that encourages sparse solutions\n",
    "by forcing some of the coefficients to be exactly zero.\n",
    "This makes it useful for feature selection and can help avoid overfitting by reducing the number of variables in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "L2 regularization, also known as Ridge regularization, adds a penalty term that shrinks the coefficients towards zero,\n",
    "but does not force them to be exactly zero. This can help reduce the effect of multicollinearity in the data and can also help prevent overfitting.\n",

    "due to the presence of the regularization terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some general guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "Sign of the coefficient: The sign of the coefficient indicates whether the feature has a positive or negative effect on the target variable.\n",
    "For example, if the coefficient for a feature is positive, then an increase in the value of that feature\n",

    "A larger magnitude indicates a stronger relationship. However, it's important to keep in mind that the magnitude of the coefficient\n",
    "can be influenced by the scale of the feature and the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularization term: The regularization terms in Elastic Net Regression can shrink the magnitude of the coefficients towards zero, \n",

    "A larger value of the regularization parameter can result in more coefficients being shrunk towards zero, which can lead to a simpler model, \n",
