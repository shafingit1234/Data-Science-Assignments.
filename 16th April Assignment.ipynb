    "1. Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost): AdaBoost is one of the most well-known and widely used boosting algorithms. \n",
    "In AdaBoost, each weak learner is trained on a modified version of the dataset, where samples that were \n",
    "misclassified by the previous learner are assigned higher weights. The final boosted model combines the \n",

    "called gradient descent to minimize a loss function. Each subsequent weak learner is trained to fit the \n",
    "negative gradient of the loss function with respect to the current predictions, effectively correcting \n",

    "3. Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost): XGBoost is an extension of Gradient Boosting that uses a more \n",

    "computing and a weighted quantile sketch to improve the speed and accuracy of the algorithm.\n",
