    "Random Forest Regressor reduces the risk of overfitting through several mechanisms:\n",
    "\n",
    "Bootstrap Aggregating (Bagging): The random forest algorithm uses a technique called bagging, \n",
    "where multiple samples of the original dataset are drawn randomly with replacement to create new subsets of data. \n",
    "These subsets are used to train individual decision trees, which are then combined to make the final prediction. \n",
    "Bagging helps to reduce the variance of the model by introducing randomness and reducing the impact of individual noisy observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Randomness: In addition to using a subset of the training data, random forest also randomly selects a \n",
    "subset of features at each node of the decision tree. This helps to reduce the correlation between the trees \n",
    "and prevent them from focusing too much on any one feature or set of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Max Features Parameter: Random forest allows us to specify the maximum number of features that can be considered at each split. \n",
    "This parameter controls the complexity of the trees and helps to prevent overfitting.\n",

    "Out-of-Bag Error: Random forest also uses out-of-bag (OOB) error estimation to evaluate the performance of the model.\n",
