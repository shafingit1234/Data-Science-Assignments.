    "    It is a collection of software functions and procedures. In simple terms, API means a software code that can be accessed or executed.\n",

    "    Here if we pay attention to the work of the waitor, he/she is acting as an interface between a hungry beast and\n",
    "    the kitchen where food is getting prepared. You will neither go to the kitchen to collect your order nor will you tell,\n",
    "    the kitchen staff what you want, all of this is being taken care by our humble waitor.\n",
    "    APi does similar work, it takes our request and responds by giving us desired results.\n",
