    "1. Univariate feature selection: This method evaluates each feature individually to determine its relationship with the target variable. \n",

    "random forests. RFE continues to remove features until the optimal number of features is reached.\n",

    "This can cause logistic regression models to be biased towards the majority class, \n",
    "leading to poor performance for the minority class. Here are some strategies for handling imbalanced datasets in logistic regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Resampling: This involves either oversampling the minority class (i.e., creating new synthetic samples from the minority class) or \n",
    "undersampling the majority class (i.e., randomly removing samples from the majority class). \n",

    "2. Cost-sensitive learning: This involves assigning different misclassification costs to each class, such that misclassifying the minority\n",
    "class is penalized more heavily than misclassifying the majority class. This can be achieved by adjusting the threshold for class prediction, \n",
